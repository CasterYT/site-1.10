### Antenna Technologies for 5G and Future Wireless Communications
Online Project-based Research programme led by [Prof. Kenneth Tong](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/1241), UCL, UK
* Learnt about basic antenna definitions, such as impedance match, bandwidth, gain, directivity, polarisation and array factor
* Applied numerical modelling tool CST to design antennas, with particular reference to a printed patch antenna
* Design antenna to fulfill the requirements for mobile communications
* Did a final project designing a mobile phone antenna for 5G millimetre wave bands
* Paper ["A microstrip patch antenna for 5G mobile communications"](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2580/1/012063/meta) was accepted at the 3rd International Conference on Signal Processing and Machine Learning (CONF-SPML 2023)
